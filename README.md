# Praqma R&D

Praqma research and development work issue tracker. We make our research in public using github issues.

All research usually ends with a commit, like some learnings in markdown format, a blog post or similar.


## Usage repo and R&D issues

Idea:

* large areas of research could have their own repositories, like or chef research: https://github.com/Praqma/study-succotash
* if they don't have their own repo, it could be a milestone or label here in this repo
* misc and simpler things, could to start with just be issue here and without any scope or context


## Current areas

* Docker: Subdirectory [/docker](/docker) have a separate [readme](/docker/README.md)

* HashiCorp Vault: Subdirectory [/vault](/vault) have a separate [readme](/vault/README.md)

* ELK stack: Subdirectory [/elk](/elk) have a separate [readme](/elk/README.md)

* Pipelines: Subdirectory [/pipelines](/pipelines) have a separate [readme](/pipelines/README.md)
